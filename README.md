# SearchEngine-Flask

Search Engine 
Searching in 1M Pictures 	
Bechir Anoir Chabchoub
This project consists of building a search engine using one million pictures.
The input I got before starting this project is: 
-A database of 1 million pictures (Thumbnails)
-EH Descriptors: every picture has a vector of features
-HT Descriptors: every picture has a vector of features
-Tags

To build the search engine, I followed this logic: 
Prepare the environment 
So, for this project, I opted as technologies: 
-MongoDB: as my NoSQL database (great choice for this kind of data)  
-Python: to process the data and classify the pictures using KMeans
 
-Flask: to Create the API rest architecture to send and receive data from the database 
  
Prepare the Data
In order to prepare Data: 
I Created a class called Metadata where I am going to put:
The picture paths 
The List of tags
The family (or group ) where I classified the picture using eh_descriptor 
The family (or group ) where I classified the picture using ht_descriptor 

 
Classify the Data 

To Classify the data: 
I used K-means algorithm which is a very important algorithm in the world of Clustering.
Since we have a data with 1M lines. It took too much time to get the result 
I stocked the Output of clustering from both descriptors in one file to make it reusable ( I donâ€™t need to start the K-means algorithm every time I try to reorder or change my data architecture ( mapping).
 
Put Data in the Database
After getting all the data well prepared, I started Injecting this data to the MongoDB , this action took too much time also.
 
Create the APIs 
After getting everything ready (database is ready) 
I prepared two APIs:
Search API:
-which is the main API, in this API, a template containing all the one million pictures rendered in one page. To reduce latency, I used paging to avoid having one or two minutes every time to charge the page.
 
Look for Similarity API:
-when clicking on any picture. A page containing all the related pictures (or similar ) to this specific picture will be rendered
